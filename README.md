Wufoo Form Embed Plugin For Joomla!
=================

A Joomla 2.5 plugin that embeds Wufoo forms into articles.

This plugin will load a Wufoo form in place of a shortcode. 

1. Copy and paste the Wordpress shortcode that is available from your wufoo form's code manager. 
2. Swap the straight brackets '[]' for curly ones '{}',  and away you go.

The syntax is:

	{wufoo username="youruser" formhash="m6r4z1" height="1240" header="show" ssl="true"}
